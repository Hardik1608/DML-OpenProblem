## Problem

Implement a Python function that applies the **SwiGLU activation function** to a NumPy array.

Assume the input array has already been passed through a linear projection and has shape `(batch_size, 2d)`. Round each output to four decimal places and return the result as a NumPy array of the shape `(batch_size, d)`.
