## Solution Explanation

The key insight is to use numpy's vectorized operations to efficiently calculate distances between the query point and all data points simultaneously, then select the k smallest distances.

## Algorithm Steps:

Convert to numpy arrays - Transform the input tuples into numpy arrays for vectorized operations
Calculate distances - Use broadcasting to compute Euclidean distance from query point to all points at once
Find k nearest - Use np.argsort() to get indices of points sorted by distance, then take first k
Return as tuples - Convert the selected points back to tuple format

## Key Implementation Details:

Vectorized distance calculation: np.sqrt(np.sum((points_array - query_array) ** 2, axis=1)) computes all distances in one operation instead of looping
Broadcasting: numpy automatically handles the subtraction between the query point and all data points
Efficient sorting: np.argsort() returns indices of sorted elements without actually sorting the array, allowing us to select just the k smallest
Dimension agnostic: The solution works for any number of dimensions (2D, 3D, etc.) without modification

Time Complexity: O(n log n) where n is the number of points, dominated by the sorting step
Space Complexity: O(n) for storing the distance array

## Edge Case Handling:

Empty points list returns empty result
k larger than available points returns all points
Single point datasets work correctly
Duplicate points at same distance are handled by numpy's stable sorting

The numpy approach is much more efficient than a naive loop-based implementation, especially for large datasets, as it leverages optimized C implementations for mathematical operations.
